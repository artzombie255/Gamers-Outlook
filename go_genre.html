            &emsp;The evolution of video games and their genres ranges back all the way to 1978 with the
            origination of the action & arcade game genre. Early on the classification of the video game
            genres were very broad. From 1980-1984, Softalk, an American magazine ran its Top Thirty list
            using the video game categories, strategy, adventure, fantasy, and arcade. Aside from Softalk,
            The Computer Gaming World (CGW) magazine also had a set of categories which are arcade,
            wargame, adventure, strategy, simulation, and role-playing adventure.
        </p>

            &emsp;The expansion of the video game genres was brought about by the popularity of video
            games that had common features. Over the years video game genres have evolved with many
            being dropped and new ones added with the current major video game genres as follows. Action,
            Adventure, Role-Playing Games(RPG), First-Person Shooter (FPS), Strategy, Simulation, Sports,
            Puzzle, MMORPG, and most recently, Battle Royals. These genres cover the most popular and
            largest video games but this is not a fully extensive list. Online there is said to be upwards of 120
            recognized video game genres.

            &emsp;With video games becoming the massive success that they became, Many companies
            wanted to try their hand at creating unique branded systems to run their trademarked and
            copy-written games. The first video game console dates back to 1972 and was called the
            Odyssey. This console had 28 games and its popularity fizzled out. Following Odyssey, Atari
            drew inspiration and successfully released Pong, leading to a lawsuit of $100 million dollars.
            Atari proceeded to release the Atari 2600 which began the start of the second generation of game
            consoles. In 1983, the North American video game industry “crashed” This was caused by the
            oversaturation of low-quality games which led to many video game companies' bankruptcy.

            &emsp;Video game consoles began to make a comeback with the third generation of game
            consoles starting in 1985 with the Nintendo Entertainment System. Towards 1989, Nintendo
            continued to release successful consoles like the Game Boy Color and around this time the
            console war began. Sega, another video game company, successfully released the 16-bit Genesis
            console. Going forward many companies began to jump on the video game console train which
            led to the current day. The major Video game Console-creating companies are Atari Inc., Bandai
            Namco Studios Inc., Sega Holdings Co., Nintendo Co., Microsoft Corporation, and Sony
            Corporation.
