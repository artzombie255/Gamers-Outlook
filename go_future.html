        &emsp;Video games seem to be moving in a direction of increased immersion with VR and AR
        systems. As well as better graphics in general. In such a short time games were taken from the
        pixelated arcade games of the 80s and into the high graphics games of now like GTA 5 and other
        similar games. There is also a trend where games are taking up more and more space on
        computers. The increased graphics have a hand in this as better graphics require more storage
        space. Additionally, there is a trend where games are getting more and more expensive. This is
        especially clear with Nintendo Switch games going up in price. When the Switch was first
        released Nintendo brand games could be around $60 but lately, it has been $70 or greater.
