            &emsp;History/Background of Video Games. The first video game is a topic of debate and it
            depends on your definition of a video game. The “game” that started the whole thing was called
            the Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device. This was more of a simulation where the player
            would use knobs to adjust a missile's trajectory to try and hit targets that were placed on top of
            the screen. Another claim to being the first video game is Tennis for Two, being made in 1958
            and run with a Brookhaven National Laboratory oscilloscope. It was made by William
            Higinbotham and was much more well-known, as well as expanded on the ideas and invention of
            CRT technology. One of the most well-known early video games was pong, this game earned its
            spot in the history books and has inspired many recreations and similar games.
